	  J. Díaz for fixing these problems.
	* collectd: Handling of the `Include' configuration option has been
	  fixed.
	* rrdtool plugin: Make sure initialization is run only once. This

2009-06-02, Version 4.6.3
	* Build system, various plugins: Many build fixes for FreeBSD,
	  OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X. Big thanks to Doug MacEachern
	  for many fixes and providing a build system for many platforms,
	  Ulf Zimmermann for providing a FreeBSD system and Simon Kuhnle for
	  providing an OpenBSD system.
	* collectd: Two bugs with the threshold checking have been fixed. The

	* filter subsystem: Allow `Chains' without default targets.
	* liboping: A patch to comply with strict aliasing rules has been
	  added.
	* timediff match: Fix a typo: The match was registered with a wrong
	  name which prevented this match to be used as documented. Thanks to
	  Bruno Prémont for finding this problem.
	* bind plugin: Fix collection of the cached RR sets. The number of RR
	  sets currently in the cache was collected as a counter value, which
	  is nonsense. Thanks to Bruno Prémont for implementing this.
	* dns plugin: Don't pass NULL to `pcap_open_live': Some systems,
	  primarily BSDs, don't take it well and crash.
	* oracle plugin: Portability to 64 bit systems has been improved.
	* postgresql plugin: The default configuration has been improved.
	* rrdtool plugin: Fix a possible race condition: If the network plugin

	  initialized, the daemon may crash.

2009-02-22, Version 4.6.1
	* collectd: Many documentation fixes.
	* Collectd::Unixsock: Error handling has been improved.
	* regex match: Don't link with the PCRE library.
	* bind plugin: Various bugs have been fixed. Thanks to Bruno Prémont
	  for finding and fixing most of them.

	  faults. Thanks to Peter Holik for his patch.

2009-02-16, Version 4.6.0
	* collectd: Added the `filter chain' infrastructure, which allows the
	  user to use `matches' and `targets' to control value processing.
	* collectd: The new `-T' command line argument allows more in-depth
	  testing of a configuration. Thanks to Doug MacEachern for the patch.
	* collectd-nagios: The Nagios integration command has been updated to
	  use libcollectdclient. The `percentage' aggregation function has
	  been added. Thanks to Fabian Linzberger for the patch.
	* libcollectdclient: A library which abstracts communication with the
	  unixsock plugin for clients has been added.
	* regex match: Match values by their identifies using regular
	  expressions.
	* timediff match: Match for values with an invalid timestamp.
	* value match: Select values by their data sources' values.
	* notification target: Create and dispatch a notification.

	  expressions.
	* set target: Set (overwrite) entire parts of an identifier.
	* bind plugin: This new plugin uses the new HTTP/XML interface to BIND
	  statistics, allowing very detailed name server statistics. Thanks to
	  Bruno Prémont for this plugin.
	* cpu plugin: Report `interrupt' separately when using
	  sysctlbyname(3) (used under *BSD). Support for sysctl(3), for
	  example for native OpenBSD support, has been added. Thanks to Simon
	  Kuhnle for the patch.
	* csv plugin: Make it possible to write values to STDOUT instead of
	  files. This is meant for testing purposes mostly. The output written
	  to STDOUT is compatible with the exec plugin. Thanks to Doug
	  MacEachern for the patch.
	* curl plugin: This new plugin can be used to read web pages and parse
	  them using the same mechanism that's used in the tail plugin.
	* dbi plugin: This new plugin allows you to connect to a variety of
	  relational databases and use SQL to gather custom statistics from
	  it. It is similar to the already existing PostgreSQL plugin but uses
	  libdbi to communicate with the database(s).
	* interface plugin: Use the ignorelist framework when selecting /
	  ignoring interfaces. This allows one to use regular expressions to
	  select interfaces, too.
	* ipmi plugin: Handle temporary IPMI error conditions more gracefully.
	  Thanks to Bruno Prémont for this patch.
	* memcached plugin: Add hit-ratio metric. Thanks to Doug MacEachern
	  for the patch.
	* mysql plugin: Allow connecting to a database via the UNIX domain
	  socket, too. Thanks to Mirko Buffoni for the patch.

	  allowing plugins to register `matches' and `targets'.
	* postgresql plugin: The preferred configuration syntax has been
	  updated to be in line with the syntax used by the new dbi and oracle
	  plugins. The compatibility code for the old syntax is present.
	  Support for the new `Result' blocks and the interval parameter has
	  been added.
	* processes plugin: Stacksize and virtual memory usage statistics have
	  been added. Portability fixes.
	* rrdcached plugin: This new plugin uses the (still in development)
	  RRD accelerator daemon, rrdcached. This daemon works very similar to
	  the original rrdtool plugin of collectd, but adds some more nice
	  features.
	* swap plugin: Code for OpenBSD (and possibly other *BSDs) has been
	  added.

2009-05-09, Version 4.5.4
	* Build system, various plugins: Many build fixes for FreeBSD,
	  OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X. Big thanks to Doug MacEachern

	* perl plugin: Portability build-fixes. Thanks to Doug MacEachern for
	  the patch.
	* rrdtool plugin: Fix a possible race condition: If the network plugin
	  is initialized and dispatches a value before the rrdtool plugin is
	  initialized, the daemon may crash.
	* memory plugin: Fix a potential problem under Solaris.

2009-02-22, Version 4.5.3
	* build system: The check for libupsclient even when `pkg-config' is
	  not available.

	* ipmi plugin: Fix an off-by-one error which could cause segmentation
	  faults. Thanks to Peter Holik for his patch.
	* tcpconns plugin: An endianness problem has been fixed in the *BSD
	  code. Thanks to "thated" for reporting this.

2009-01-02, Version 4.5.2
	* build system: Check for `mysql.h' and `mysql/mysql.h', since the
	  file may be in both locations, especially when the database was
	  installed in a non-standard path. Thanks to Dusty Doris for
	  reporting this.
	* build system: Handle the _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS defined, needed by
	  Solaris, in the configure script automatically.
	* build system, tcpconns plugin: Check for `kvm_nlist' and
	  `kvm_openfiles' before enabling the plugin: Solaris provides a KVM
	  library with similar functions to the BSD variant, but doesn't
	  provide these necessary functions.
	* collectd.conf(5): Various fixes and clarifications.
	* collectd: Remove a GNUism (unnamed unions), thus improving
	  portability.
	* collectd, apcups plugin: Include "collectd.h" before <stdlib.h>.
	  This solves portability problems, especially for Solaris.
	* dns plugin: Fix a portability problem with NetBSD.
	* filecount plugin: Fix an off-by-one error. This error may cause a
	  segmentation fault.
	* network plugin: Fix the handling of `type' in the network protocol.
	  Due to a programming mistake, only 4 or 8 bytes would be copied to a
	  much larger buffer. This caused the `type' to be transferred much
	  more often than necessary. In some cases, e. g. the `cpu' and
	  `cpufreq' plugins being used at the same time, data may be corrupted
	  in those files. Thanks to Bruno Prémont for debugging and reporting
	  this issue.
	* processes plugin: Fix a possible segmentation fault when specifying
	  invalid configuration options.
	* unixsock plugin: Make sure the initialization function is run only
	  once. This resolves a file descriptor leak under systems which run
	  the initialization more than once, such as Solaris.

2008-10-16, Version 4.5.1
	* build system: Change `--enable-<plugin>' to abort with an error if
	  dependencies are not met. Thanks to Bruno Prémont for the patch.
	  Also, the poisoning of various string functions has been restricted
	  to debug builds.
	* collectd: Fix a memory leak in the global value cache. With every
	  *missing* value a couple of bytes would be leaked. Another memory
	  leak in the configuration handling code has been fixed. Thanks to
	  Niraj Tolia for reporting these issues.
	* collectd: Fix an off-by-one error in the ignorelist functionality.
	  When using regular expressions, the last character would be missing,
	  possibly matching differently from what one would expect.
	* collectdmon: Don't block SIGCHLD. This fixes a potential portability
	  problem.
	* collectd-nagios: Fix handling of the `-d' option. Thanks to Fabian
	  Linzberger for reporting the bug.
	* iptables plugin: Fix an off-by-one error. If a string was just one
	  character too long, it was truncated instead of reporting an error.
	* network plugin: Fix a memory leak in the configuration handling
	  code. Thanks to Niraj Tolia for reporting this issue.
	* perl plugin: Log an error message if bootstrapping `Collectd' fails.
	* postgresql plugin: Don't reopen connection during reinitialization.
	  This fixes a bug under Solaris and potentially other platforms.
	  Missing calls to `PQclear' have been added, too. This fixes memory
	  leaks. Thanks to ``Admin'' for reporting these bugs.
	* snmp plugin: Don't expect null-terminated strings from the Net-SNMP
	  library.
	* tail plugin: Call `clearerr(3)' after reading an EOF. This fixes
	  problems with some `libc's. Thanks to Matthias Lay for reporting the
	  bug.

2008-09-04, Version 4.5.0
	* collectd: Added the ability to flush certain identifiers.

	  Specification'.
	* notify_email plugin: This new plugin sends out notifications via
	  email, using the `esmtp' library.
	* onewire plugin: The new experimental(!) onewire plugin reads values,
	  such as temperatures, from sensors connected to the computer via the
	  onewire bus.
	* perl plugin: Improved synchronized access to internal data structures
	  and fixed a possible dead-lock.
	* perl plugin: Added the ability to flush certain identifiers and marked
	  plugin_flush_all() and plugin_flush_one() as deprecated in favor of
	  plugin_flush().
	* perl plugin: Added the ability to configure Perl plugins.
	* postgresql plugin: The new postgresql plugin collects statistics
	  about or from a PostgreSQL database.
	* processes plugin: The `ProcessMatch' option has been added.
	* rrdtool plugin: Implement throttling of the `update queue' to lessen
	  IO load.
	* tcpconns plugin: This plugin has been ported to OpenBSD.
	* thermal plugin: The new thermal plugin collects system temperatures
	  using Linux ACPI thermal zone data.

2009-01-02, Version 4.4.5
	* build system: Check for `mysql.h' and `mysql/mysql.h', since the
	  file may be in both locations, especially when the database was
	  installed in a non-standard path. Thanks to Dusty Doris for
	  reporting this.
	* build system: Handle the _POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS defined, needed by
	  Solaris, in the configure script automatically.
	* collectd.conf(5): Various fixes and clarifications.
	* apcups plugin: Include "collectd.h" before <stdlib.h>. This solves

	* network plugin: Fix the handling of `type' in the network protocol.
	  Due to a programming mistake, only 4 or 8 bytes would be copied to a
	  much larger buffer. This caused the `type' to be transferred much
	  more often than necessary. In some cases, e. g. the `cpu' and
	  `cpufreq' plugins being used at the same time, data may be corrupted
	  in those files. Thanks to Bruno Prémont for debugging and reporting
	  this issue.
	* unixsock plugin: Make sure the initialization function is run only
	  once. This resolves a file descriptor leak under systems which run
	  the initialization more than once, such as Solaris.

2008-10-16, Version 4.4.4
	* build system: Change `--enable-<plugin>' to abort with an error if
	  dependencies are not met. Thanks to Bruno Prémont for the patch.

	* build system: Use pkg-config to detect the upsclient library.
	* collectd: Try even harder to determine the endianess of the
	  architecture collectd is being built on.
	* disk plugin: Fix for Linux 2.4: A wrong field was used as the name
	  of disks.
	* dns plugin: Fix compilation errors with BIND versions 19991001
	  through 19991005.
	* network plugin: Bugfix in the init routine: The init function
	  cleared a buffer regardless of its contents. This could lead to lost
	  values under Solaris.
	* nginx plugin: Remove usage of the thread-unsafe `strtok' function.
	* vserver plugin: Remove usage of the thread-unsafe `readdir'
	  function.
	* wireless plugin: Work around incorrect noise and power values
	  returned by some broken drivers.

	  René Rebe and Siegmund Gorr for reporting this.

2008-05-06, Version 4.4.0
	* collectd: Internal code cleanups.
	* collectd: Added support for a `Flush' command in the unixsock and
	  exec plugins. This command can be used to force a plugin (or all) to
	  flush its values to disk.

	  source only, making it possible to configure different thresholds
	  for each data source.

	  peer verification.
	* ascent plugin: The new ascent plugin reads and parses the statistics
	  page of an Ascent server.

	  sensor values via IPMI, the intelligent platform management
	  interface.
	* iptables plugin: The iptc library that is used by the iptables
	  plugin has been added to the distribution, because it is not
	  provided by all distributions and removed from at least one.
	* powerdns plugin: The new powerdns plugin reads statistics from an
	  authoritative or a recursing PowerDNS name server.
	* rrdtool plugin: The size of the files generated with the default
	  configuration has been decreased.
	* tail plugin: The new tail plugin can be used to gather statistics by

	* build system: Portability fixes: Automatically define "_REENTRANT"
	  if the libc expects it.
	* collectd: Error and warning messages have been improved.
	* collectd: Check for the BYTE_ORDER and BIG_ENDIAN defines before
	  using them.
	* apache plugin: Allocate new memory when reading a webpage instead of
	  using a buffer of static size.

2008-02-18, Version 4.3.0
	* collectd: Notifications have been added to the daemon. Notifications
	  are status messages that may be associated with a data instance.
	* collectd: Threshold checking has been added to the daemon. This
	  means that you can configure threshold values for each data
	  instance. If this threshold is exceeded a notification will be
	  created.
	* collectd: The new `FQDNLookup' option tells the daemon to use the
	  full qualified domain name as the hostname, not just the host part
	  es returned by `gethostname(2)'.
	* collectd: Support for more than one `TypesDB' file has been added.
	  This is useful when one such file is included in a package but one
	  wants to add custom type definitions.
	* collectd: The `Include' config option has been expanded to handle
	  entire directories and shell wildcards.
	* collectdmon: The new `collectdmon' binary detects when collectd
	  terminates and automatically restarts it again.

	* hddtemp plugin: The new `TranslateDevicename' option lets you
	  disable the translation from device names to major-minor-numbers.
	* logfile plugin: Handling of notifications has been added.
	* ntpd plugin: The new `ReverseLookups' can be used to disable reverse
	  domain name lookups in this plugin.
	* perl plugin: Many internal changes added support for handling multiple
	  threads making the plugin reasonably usable inside collectd. The API has
	  been extended to support notifications and export global variables to
	  Perl plugins; callbacks now have to be identified by name rather than a
	  pointer to a subroutine. The plugin is no longer experimental.
	* uuid plugin: The new UUID plugin sets the hostname to an unique
	  identifier for this host. This is meant for setups where each client
	  may migrate to another physical host, possibly going through one or
	  more name changes in the process. Thanks to Richard Jones from
	  Red Hat's Emerging Technology group for this plugin.
	* libvirt: The new libvirt plugin uses the `libvirt' library to query
	  CPU, disk and network statistics about guest systems on the same
	  physical server. Thanks to Richard Jones from Red Hat's Emerging
	  Technology group for this plugin.

2008-04-22, Version 4.2.7
	* build system: Improved detection of several libraries, especially if
	  they are in non-standard paths.
	* build system: Portability fixes: Automatically define "_REENTRANT"
	  if the libc expects it.
	* collectd: Error and warning messages have been improved.
	* collectd: Check for the BYTE_ORDER and BIG_ENDIAN defines before
	  using them.
	* apache plugin: Allocate new memory when reading a webpage instead of
	  using a buffer of static size.
	* exec plugin: Close (almost) all filedescriptors before exec(2)ing
	  the program.
	* hddtemp plugin: Error and warning messages have been improved.
	* sensors plugin: Fix sensor collection for some chip types.

2008-03-29, Version 4.2.6
	* collectd: Improved error messages when parsing the configuration.
	* sensors plugin: Fix temperature collection with libsensors4.
	* unixsock plugin: Fix mixed input and output operation on streams.
	* wireless plugin: Fix reading noise value.

2008-03-04, Version 4.2.5
	* apache plugin: Improved initialization and error messages.
	* exec plugin: Set supplementary group IDs.
	* network plugin:
	  + Create separate threads for reading from the socket and parsing
	    and dispatching incoming packets. Versions prior to this may have
	    problems in high-load situations, where the socket receive buffers
	    overflows, resulting in gaps in the data.
	  + Use `memcpy' when constructing/parsing a package to avoid
	    alignment problems on weird architectures, such as Sparc.
	  + Translate doubles to/from the x86 byte representation to ensure
	    cross-platform compatibility.
	* ping plugin: Correct the handling of the `TTL' setting.
	* rrdtool plugin: Ensure correct handling of the `RRATimespan' option.
	* swap plugin: Reapply a patch for Solaris.
	* tcpconns plugin: Portability improvements.

2008-01-21, Version 4.2.4
	* unixsock plugin: A bug in the unixsock plugin caused it not to set
	  the permission on the socket as documented in the manpage. Thanks to
	  Evgeny Chukreev for fixing this issue.
	* collectd: The documentation has been improved.

2007-12-28, Version 4.2.3
	* sensors plugin: Updated the plugin to build and work with version 3
	  of the libsensors library.

2007-12-15, Version 4.2.2
	* nginx plugin: Incorrect comparison of strings lead to a segfault
	  when using the plugin. Thanks to Saulius Grigaliunas for fixing
	  this.
	* logfile plugin: The config option `Timestamp' was handled
	  incorrectly and basically always active. Thanks to Luke Heberling
	  for fixing this.

2007-11-08, Version 4.2.1
	* tcpconns plugin: Don't complain about a missing file if IPv6 is not
	  enabled on the host.
	* snmp plugin: Fix a memory leak.

2007-10-27, Version 4.2.0
	* collectd: The new config option `Include' lets you include other
	  configfiles and thus split up your config into smaller parts. This
	  may be especially interesting for the snmp plugin to keep the data
	  definitions separate from the host definitions.
	* ipvs plugin: The new `ipvs' plugin collects IPVS connection statistics
	  (number of connections, octets and packets for each service and
	  destination). Thanks to Sebastian Harl for this plugin.
	* memcached plugin: The new `memcached' plugin connects to a memcached
	  daemon process and collects statistics of this distributed caching
	  system. Thanks to Antony Dovgal for contributing this plugin.
	* nginx plugin: The new `nginx' plugin reads the status page of an
	  nginx daemon and saves the handled connections and requests.
	* perl plugin: Many changes, including the added `EnableDebugger'
	  config option which lets you debug your Perl plugins more easily.
	* rrdtool plugin: Use the thread-safe RRD-library if available. Try to
	  be more thread-safe otherwise by locking calls to the library.
	* snmp plugin: Added the options `Scale' and `Shift' to Data-blocks to
	  correct the values returned by SNMP-agents. If a <data> block is
	  defined as `table' the instance is now optional. The sequence number
	  is used as the type-instance in this case. The new `InstancePrefix'
	  option allows to add arbitrary prefixes to the type-instance.
	* tcpconns plugin: The new `tcpconns' plugin collects the number of
	  certain TCP connections and what state they're in. This can be used
	  to see how many connections your FTP server has to handle or how
	  many outgoing connections your mailserver has open.

2008-01-11, Version 4.1.6
	* unixsock plugin: A bug in the unixsock plugin caused it not to set
	  the permission on the socket as documented in the manpage. Thanks to
	  Evgeny Chukreev for fixing this issue.
	* collectd: The documentation has been improved.

2007-12-27, Version 4.1.5
	* rrdtool plugin: Fix a memory leak that only occurred in very-low-
	  memory situations.
	* sensors plugin: Updated the plugin to build and work with version 3
	  of the libsensors library.

2007-11-08, Version 4.1.4
	* Build system: Improve detection of the rrd library, especially if
	  it's in a non-standard location.
	* Build system: A bug when parsing the argument for
	  `--with-libnetsnmp' has been fixed.
	* collectd: Implement `strerror_r' if the libc doesn't provide it.
	* rrdtool plugin: Fix a bug in the shutdown sequence that might cause
	  a deadlock or delay when shutting down the daemon.
	* snmp plugin: Fix a memory leak.

2007-10-24, Version 4.1.3
	* collectd: A build issue under Solaris has been resolved by renaming
	  data types.
	* rrdtool plugin: Use the thread-safe RRD-library if available. Try to
	  be more thread-safe otherwise by locking calls to the library.

2007-09-28, Version 4.1.2
	* apcups plugin: Fix reporting of the `load percent' data.
	* wireless plugin: Correct the handling of cards returning signal and
	  noise quality as percentage.
	* perl plugin: Fix a possible buffer overflow in get_module_name().
	* build system: Further improve the detection of libraries.
	* netlink plugin: Build issues under some older versions of the Linux
	  includes (i. e. Debian Sarge) have been fixed.
	* snmp plugin: Fix a potential segfault when a host times out. Add
	  support for the `timeticks' type. 

2007-09-12, Version 4.1.1
	* Build system: The detection of `libnetlink' has been improved.
	* collectd: The documentation has been fixed in numerous places.
	* exec plugin: Setting the group under which to run a program has been
	  fixed.
	* collectd: The `sstrerror' function was improved to work correctly
	  with the broken GNU version of `strerror_r'.
	* collectd: Write an error message to STDERR when loading of a plugin
	  fails.
	* apcups plugin: Fix the `types' used to submit the values: They still
	  has an `apcups_' prefix which doesn't work anymore.
	* rrdtool plugin: Create new RRD-files with the `begin' time set to
	  whatever the client thinks is `now'..

2007-09-01, Version 4.1.0
	* Build system: The build system has been changed to automatically
	  disable all plugins, which are missing dependencies. The dependency
	  checking has been removed from the plugins themselves to remove
	  redundancy.
	* Flexible interval: The interval of collected data is now sent along
	  with the data itself over the network, so that the interval-settings
	  of server and clients no longer needs to match.
	* netlink plugin: The new `netlink' plugin connects to the Linux
	  kernel using a netlink socket and uses it to query information about
	  interfaces, qdiscs and classes.
	* rrdtool plugin: The cache is now dumped to disk in an extra thread
	  to not block data collection.
	* snmp plugin: The new `snmp' plugin can read values from SNMP enabled
	  network devices, such as switches, routers, thermometers, rack
	  monitoring servers, etc. The collectd-snmp(5) manpage documents this
	  plugin.
	* unixsock plugin: Added the `LISTVAL' command.
	* xmms plugin: The new `xmms' plugin graphs the bitrate and frequency
	  of music played with xmms.

2007-09-28, Version 4.0.9
	* apcups plugin: Fix reporting of the `load percent' data.
	* wireless plugin: Correct the handling of cards returning signal and
	  noise quality as percentage.
	* perl plugin: Fix a possible buffer overflow in get_module_name().

2007-09-12, Version 4.0.8
	* collectd: The `sstrerror' function was improved to work correctly
	  with the broken GNU version of `strerror_r'.
	* collectd: Write an error message to STDERR when loading of a plugin
	  fails.
	* apcups plugin: Fix the `types' used to submit the values: They still
	  has an `apcups_' prefix which doesn't work anymore.
	* rrdtool plugin: Create new RRD-files with the `begin' time set to
	  whatever the client thinks is `now'..

2007-08-26, Version 4.0.7
	* documentation: Some typos have been fixed and some information has
	  been improved.
	* build system: Many fixes for detecting libraries in unusual places,
	  such as on RedHat systems. The affected libraries are `libcurl',
	  `libmysql', and `libupsclient'.
	* network plugin: Allow the `Port' option to be specified as a number
	  (i. e. without quotes).
	* nut plugin: A fix allows linking the nut plugin against
	  libupsclient, version >= 2.2.0.
	* processes plugin: Fix a potential segmentation fault.

2007-07-30, Version 4.0.6
	* sensors plugin: Fix the ignorelist functionality: Only the `type
	  instance' was used to match against the list, but the documentation
	  told otherwise. This release fixes the code, so it complies with the
	  documentation.
	* syslog plugin: Call `openlog' right when the plugin is loaded, so
	  configuration messages will end up in the logging facility.
	* conrtib/fedora: The contributed specfile for Fedora has been
	  updated.

2007-07-05, Version 4.0.5
	* Portability: More fixes for OpenBSD have been included.

2007-06-24, Version 4.0.4
	* cpu plugin: Fixed the Solaris code.
	* dns plugin: Fixed a build issue for OpenBSD.
	* interface plugin: Fixed the Solaris code.
	* load plugin: Fixed the alternative `/proc' Linux code.
	* memory plugin: Fixed the Solaris code.
	* oconfig: Don't require `-lfl' anymore.

2007-06-19, Version 4.0.3
	* cpu plugin: Fix the Darwin / Mac OS X code.
	* ping plugin: Use the return value of `getpid', not its address.
	* csv, rrdtool plugin: Fixed a bug that prevented an buffer to be
	  initialized correctly.
	* configure: Added `--with-nan-emulation' to aid cross compilation.

2007-06-12, Version 4.0.2
	* hddtemp and ntpd plugin: Corrected the parsing of port numbers when
	  they're given in numerically form.

2007-06-07, Version 4.0.1
	* iptables plugin: A bug in the configuration routine has been fixed.
	  Setting a comment in the configfile will no longer cause a
	  segmentation fault.

2007-06-03, Version 4.0.0
	* collectd: The plugin-infrastructure has been changed to allow for
	  more types of plugins, namely `write' and `log' plugins.
	* collectd: The read-function has been changed to read many plugins in
	  parallel, using threads. Thus, plugins generally need to use
	  thread-safe functions from now on.
	* collectd: The '-t' command line options allows to perform syntax tests
	  of the configuration file and exit immediately.
	* csv plugin: The new `csv' plugin handles output to `comma separated
	  values'-files.
	* rrdtool plugin: The new `rrdtool' plugin handles output to
	  RRD-files. Data can be cached to combine multiple updates into one
	  write to increase IO-performance.
	* network plugin: The new `network' plugin handles IO via the network.
	  It implements a different, much more extensible protocol which can
	  combine many values in one packet, decreasing the number of UDP-
	  packets being sent. It can read from and send to the network and
	  with the appropriate configuration even forward packets to other
	  networks.
	* unixsock plugin: The new `unixsock' plugin provides an interface to
	  communicate with the daemon while it is running. Right now the
	  commands `GETVAL' and `PUTVAL' are implemented, but more are to
	  come.
	* perl plugin: The new `perl' plugin allows you to write extensions
	  for collectd in the scripting-language Perl.
	* logfile plugin: The new `logfile' plugin writes logmessages to files
	  or STDOUT or STDERR.
	* syslog plugin: The new `syslog' plugin sends logmessages to the
	  system's syslog daemon.
	* entropy plugin: The new `entropy' plugin collects the amount of
	  entropy currently being available to the system.
	* exec plugin: The new `exec' plugin forks child processes and reads
	  back values provided by the forked processes.
	* iptables plugin: The new `iptables' plugin reads counters from
	  iptables rules. Thanks to Sjoerd van der Berg for contributing this
	  plugin.
	* irq plugin: The new `irq' plugin collects the IRQ-counters. Thanks
	  to Peter Holik for contributing this plugin.
	* nut plugin: The new `nut' plugin connects the upsd of the `network
	  ups tools' and reads information about the connected UPS.
	* apache plugin: Support for lighttpd's `BusyServers' (aka.
	  connections) field was added by Florent Monbillard.
	* collectd-nagios: The new `collectd-nagios' binary queries values
	  from collectd, parses them and exits according to Nagios-standards.
	* manpages: The manpages have been improved a lot.

2007-09-28, Version 3.11.7
	* wireless plugin: Correct the handling of cards returning signal and
	  noise quality as percentage.

2007-08-31, Version 3.11.6
	* processes plugin: Fix a potential segmentation fault.

2007-05-29, Version 3.11.5
	* configure: Added `AC_SYS_LARGEFILE' for LFS.
	* ntpd plugin: Fix a potential buffer overflow.
	* processes plugin: Fix a bug when run under Linux 2.4. All processes
	  were accounted as `zombies'.

2007-04-10, Version 3.11.4
	* dns plugin: Change the order of includes to make the plugin compile
	  under FreeBSD.

2007-03-30, Version 3.11.3
	* configure: Have the configure-script define `HAVE_LIBKSTAT' instead
	  of the unused `COLLECT_KSTAT'.

2007-02-11, Version 3.11.2
	* plugin: Catch NULL-pointer and try to fix them. Otherwise the
	  NULL-pointer may have been passed to `printf' which causes a
	  segfault with some libcs.

2007-02-10, Version 3.11.1
	* df plugin: Some wrong defines have been fixed so the plugin works
	  under Solaris again.
	* dns plugin: The usage of a struct has been fixed to work with
	  non-GNU libcs.
	* processes plugin: Some missing defines have been added so the plugin
	  compiles cleanly under FreeBSD and presumably other UNIXes.

2006-12-22, Version 3.11.0
	* collectd: The new command line option `-P' makes it easier for
	  distributors to change the location of PID-files.
	* collectd: The daemon shuts down faster now which makes it easier to
	  write init.d-scripts for it.
	* apache plugin: Increase the buffersize to 16k, because the 4k buffer
	  caused problems every now and then.
	* df plugin: New config options allow to ignore certain mountpoints,
	  filesystem types or devices.
	* dns plugin: The new dns plugin uses `libpcap' to capture DNS traffic
	  and interprets it. It collects traffic as well as qtype, opcode and
	  rcode counts.
	* email plugin: Sebastian Harl has contributed this plugin which
	  counts received mails in categories (e. g. ham, spam, virus), spam
	  score (as given by SpamAssassin) and check types.
	* mbmon plugin: Flavio Stanchina has contributed this plugin which
	  uses `mbmon' to gather information from sensors on the motherboard.
	* processes plugin: Collect detailed statistics for configured
	  processes, that's process and thread count, CPU usage, resident
	  segment size and pagefaults.
	* multimeter plugin: Peter Holik contributed a new plugin which
	  queries multimeters.
	* sensors plugin: Lubos Stanek has put much effort into improving this
	  plugin, including `extended naming', collection of voltage values
	  and the possibility to ignore certain values.

2006-12-21, Version 3.10.4
	* Max Kellermann has identified a bug in the server routine: When
	  opening a socket fails the daemon will (re)try opening the socket in
	  an endless loop, ultimately leading to a `EMFILE' error.

2006-11-04, Version 3.10.3
	* Lubos Stanek has identified a bug in the ntpd-plugin: When the
	  ntpd's reply was sent in more than one packet, the buffer size was
	  calculated incorrectly, resulting in the reading of uninitialized or
	  freed memory.

2006-11-01, Version 3.10.2
	* The sample config file has been improved.
	* Errors in the manpages have been corrected.
	* The ping-plugin now adds hosts during initialization, not during
	  startup. This speeds up startup when no network connectivity is
	  available. Also, the hosts are being added later when the network is
	  available.
	* Improved BSD-support for the df-plugin.
	* Fixed syntax errors in the swap-plugin for Mac OS X.
	* Fix a wrong structure being passed to `getnameinfo' in the ntpd-
	  plugin.
	* Don't disable the mysql-plugin if connecting to the database fails
	  during initialization. Instead, try again in increasing intervals.

2006-07-19, Version 3.10.1
	* A bug in the apcups plugin was fixed: Is the plugin is loaded, but
	  the apcups cannot be reached, unconnected sockets will pile up and
	  eventually lead to `Too many open files' errors.

2006-07-09, Version 3.10.0
	* The `disk' plugin has been ported to Darwin.
	* The `battery' plugin should work on many Apple computers now.
	* The `traffic' plugin can now ignore certain interfaces. Also,
	  statistics for sent/received packets and errors have been added.
	* A plugin to monitor APC UPSes using `apcupsd' has been added. Thanks
	  to Anthony Gialluca for contributing this plugin and providing me
	  with a test environment :)
	* A plugin for monitoring an NTP instance and the local clock drift
	  has been added.

2006-06-25, Version 3.9.4
	* The Solaris code in the `swap' plugin has been changed to reflect
	  the numbers returned by `swap -s'. Thanks to Christophe Kalt for
	  working this out.
	* The debugging system has been fixed to work with the Sun libc.
	* When built without librrd the variable `operating_mode' could be
	  uninitialized. Thanks to David Elliot for reporting the bug.

2006-06-01, Version 3.9.3
	* Fixed the ping-plugin under FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Potentially other
	  operating systems also profit from the changes, but I wasn't able to
	  check that.
	* Changed the build system to find the netinet-includes under FreeBSD
	  and therefore successfully build the `liboping' library there.

2006-05-09, Version 3.9.2
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-05-09, Version 3.8.5
	* Applied a patch to the `liboping' library. Due to a bug in the
	  sequence checking the `ping' plugin stopped working after
	  approximately 7.6 days.

2006-04-21, Version 3.9.1
	* Build issues with Solaris and possible other architectures have been
	  resolved.
	* Problems when building the `apache'-plugin without `libcurl' have
	  been resolved.
	* A bug in the `ping' plugin has been fixed. Sorry folks.

2006-04-02, Version 3.9.0
	* A plugin to monitor the Apache webserver has been added.
	  <http://httpd.apache.org/>
	* A plugin to collect statistics about virtual servers using VServer.
	  <http://linux-vserver.org/> Thanks to Sebastian Harl for writing
	  this plugin :)
	* A plugin for wireless LAN cards has been added. It monitors signal
	  strength, link quality and noise ratio..
	* A plugin for Apple hardware sensors has been added.
	* An option to compile collectd with different `step' and `heartbeat'
	  settings has been added. The size of RRAs is no longer static but
	  calculated based on the settings for `step' and `width'.
	* The `ping' plugin can now be configured to use a certain TTL.
	* A plugin to monitor the hardware sensors of Apple computers has been
	  added.
	* The plugins `cpu', `memory', `processes' and `traffic' have been
	  ported to Mach/Darwin (Mac OS X).
	* The `log mode' has been contributed by Christophe Kalt. It writes
	  the data into text files rather than RRD files.

2006-04-09, Version 3.8.4
	* Applied patch by Vincent Stehlé which improves the disk-name
	  resolution in the `hddtemp' plugin for Linux systems.

2006-04-02, Version 3.8.3
	* Applied a patch by James Byers: The MySQL plugin was not working
	  with MySQL 5.0.2 or later.

2006-03-14, Version 3.8.2
	* `utils_mount.c' has been changed to not use the `MNTTAB' defined by
	  the GNU libc, because it points to `/etc/fstab' rather than
	  `/etc/mtab'.

2006-03-13, Version 3.8.1
	* Fixes for building collectd under FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Solaris.
	* Fixes in the debian `postinst' and `init.d' scripts.

2006-03-09, Version 3.8.0
	* The `ping' plugin no longer uses `libping' but a self written
	  library named `liboping'. With this library it's possible to ping
	  multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and hostnames - in parallel.

2006-02-18, Version 3.7.2
	* A simple bug in the `battery' plugin has been fixed. It should now
	  work with ACPI based batteries as well. Thanks to Sebastian for
	  fixing this.
	* Fixing a bug that prevented collectd to be built without librrd.
	  Thanks to Werner Heuser for reporting it.

2006-02-04, Version 3.7.1
	* The new network code has been improved to build with older versions
	  of glibc.
	* Fix in `libping' sets the ICMP sequence on outgoing packets. Thanks
	  to Tommie Gannert for this patch.

2006-01-30, Version 3.7.0
	* The `battery' plugin has been added. It collects information about
	  laptop batteries..
	* The MySQL plugin has been improved: It now writes two more RRD
	  files, `mysql_qcache.rrd' and `mysql_threads.rrd'.
	* The `cpufreq' plugin now reads another file since the file it did
	  read so far causes much overhead in the kernel. Also, you need root
	  to read the old file, but not to read the new one.
	* The `hddtemp' plugin can now be configured to connect to another
	  address and/or port than localhost.
	* The `df' plugin now prefers `statvfs' over `statfs'.
	* The network code has been rewritten. collectd now supports unicast
	  and multicast, and IPv4 and IPv6. Also, the TTL of sent packages can
	  be set in the configfile.

2006-01-24, Version 3.6.2
	* Due to a bug in the configfile handling collectd wouldn't start in
	  client mode. This released fixes this.

2006-01-20, Version 3.6.1
	* Due to a bug in `configure.in' all modules and the binary were
	  linked against `libmysqlclient'. This issue is solved by this
	  release.

2006-01-17, Version 3.6.0
	* A config file has been added. This allows for loading only specific
	  plugins.
	* A `df' plugin has been added.
	* A `mysql' plugin has been added.
	* The `ping' plugin doesn't entirely give up hope when a socket error
	  occurred, but will back of and increase the intervals between tries.

2006-01-21, Version 3.5.2
	* Fixed yet another bug in the signal handling.. Stupid typo..
	* Improved the ping plugin to not give up on socket errors (backport
	  from 3.6.0).

2005-12-18, Version 3.5.1
	* The PID-file is now deleted correctly when shutting down the daemon.
	* SIGINT and SIGTERM are now handled correctly.

2005-12-16, Version 3.5.0 (Revision 326)
	* A bug in the `load' module under Solaris has been fixed.
	* The `users' module has been contributed by Sebastian Harl. It counts
	  currently logged in users.
	* The CPU module now works under FreeBSD without the use of
	  `libstatgrab', however SMP support is missing.
	* The default directories for the RRD files and the PID file now
	  depend on the compile time setting of `localstatedir'.

2005-11-15, Version 3.4.0 (Revision 236)
	* A PID-file is written to /var/run upon startup. Thanks to `Tommie'
	  from gentoo's bugzilla for writing the patch.
	* The build dependency for librrd has been removed. Binaries built
	  without librrd are client-only and will multicast their value as
	  with the `-c' argument.
	* A patch by Peter Holik adds a module for monitoring CPU frequencies.
	* The newly introduced `-f' switch prevents daemon initialization
	  (forking, closing standard filehandles, etc.) Thanks to Alvaro
	  Barcellos for this patch.

2005-11-04, Version 3.3.0 (Revision 216)
	* New modules have been added:
	  - `serial', for monitoring traffic on the serial interfaces
	  - `nfs', for graphing NFS procedure calls
	  - `tape', traffic from/to tape devices
	* The memory.rrd now accepts more than 4Gig of memory.

2005-10-26, Version 3.2.0 (Revision 200)
	* Support for graphing the processes has been added (thanks to Lyonel
	  Vincent)
	* If reading from hddtemp fails collectd will increase the time
	  between polls up to one day.
	* The init.d files have been improved.
	* Problems with the spec file have been fixed.

2005-10-16, Version 3.1.0 (Revision 194)
	* Added the `setsid' syscall to the startup code.
	* Support for hddtemp has been added (thanks to Vincent Stehlé)

2005-09-30, Version 3.0.0 (Revision 184)
	* The ability to send/receive data to/from the network (think
	  multicast) has been added.
	* Modules have been split up into shared libraries can be loaded at
	  runtime. The biggest advantage is that the core program doesn't need
	  to be linked against an external library.
	* A patch by George Kargiotakis has been applied: It fixes the sensors
	  behaviour then more than one sensor is being queried.

2005-09-16, Version 2.1.0 (Revision 172)
	* A module for swap statistics has been added.

2005-09-09, Version 2.0.0 (Revision 135)
	* Filenames can no longer be configured at program startup. The only
	  options as of this version are the directory and ping hosts.
	* CPU statistics now include Wait-IO. If provided under Linux IRQ and
	  Soft-IRQ statistics are added to `System'. 
	* Diskstats now collect read and write bytes, not sectors.
	* Ping statistics can now be collected for more than one host. There
	  is no default any more: If no host is given no host will be pinged.
	* A self-written patch for libping has been applied so it builds
	  cleanly.

2005-09-01, Version 1.8.1 (Revision 123)
	* Much improved configure-script: libraries and features may now be
	  disabled.
	* More detailed warnings/error messages when RRD update fails.

2005-08-29, Version 1.8.0:
	* Support for collecting disk statistics under Solaris.

2005-08-25, Version 1.7.0:
	* Support for libstatgrab[1] for load, memory usage and network
	  traffic. CPU- and disk-usage are not (yet) supported, since
	  libstatgrab returns insufficient information. I will contact the
	  authors.
	* Improved the CPU-initialization code for Solaris. Apparently CPUs
	  aren't necessarily counted linear which is now handled correctly.

2005-08-21, Version 1.6.0:
	* Basic support for Solaris: System load and cpu-usage can be
	  collected under Solaris, too. Other stats will follow later.
	* Many fixes in the autoconf-script
	* Collection/Museum scripts have been added under contrib/museum
	* collectd may now be started in unprivileged mode, though ping
	  statistics will not work.

2005-07-17, Version 1.5.1:
	* Diskstats-RRDs now use major/minor for naming. Some systems have
	  weird strings as disk-names..

2005-07-17, Version 1.5:
	* A new module, diskstats, has been added. It collects information
	  about the disks and partitions.

2005-07-11, Version 1.4.2:
	* The meminfo module has been changed to work with more platforms
	  and/or kernel versions.

2005-07-10, Version 1.4.1: Correct traffic stats
	* The traffic rrd-file is now created with DS-type `COUNTER' which I
	  forgot to correct when I changed that module.

2005-07-09, Version 1.4: More traffic stats
	* Traffic is now collected for all interfaces that can be found
	* Temperature-statistics are read from lm-sensors if available

2005-07-08, Version 1.3: CPU stats
	* Collecting CPU statistics now

2004-07-12, Version 1.2: Using syslog
	* collectd is now using the syslog facility to report errors, warnings
	  and the like..
	* The default directory is now /var/db/collectd

2004-07-10, Version 1.1: Minor changes
	* Nothing really useful to say ;)

2004-07-09, Version 1.0: Initial Version
	* The following modules are provided:
	  * Load average
	  * Ping time
	  * Traffic
	  * Memory info
